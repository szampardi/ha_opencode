## LSP Integration (Intelligent YAML Editing)

The app includes a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server that provides intelligent editing features for Home Assistant YAML configuration files. This is **enabled by default** because it only reads data and doesn't modify anything.

### What is LSP?

LSP (Language Server Protocol) is a standard that enables smart editor features like:
- Autocomplete suggestions
- Hover documentation
- Go-to-definition
- Error diagnostics

The HA OpenCode LSP server connects to your Home Assistant instance and provides context-aware assistance while you edit YAML files.

### LSP Features

#### Entity ID Autocomplete

When typing `entity_id:`, you get suggestions from all entities in your Home Assistant:

```yaml
automation:
  - trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: # <-- Type here and get all your entities!
```

The autocomplete shows:
- Entity ID (e.g., `light.living_room`)
- Friendly name (e.g., "Living Room Light")
- Current state (e.g., "on")
- Device class if available

#### Service Autocomplete

When typing `service:` or `action:`, you get all available services:

```yaml
action:
  - service: # <-- Type here to see all services!
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
```

Service completions include:
- Full service name (e.g., `light.turn_on`)
- Description
- Available fields/parameters

#### Area & Device Completion

Complete area and device IDs:

```yaml
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target:
      area_id: # <-- Suggests all your areas
```

#### Jinja2 Template Completion

Inside `{{ }}` templates, get function completions:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      living_room_temp:
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') }}"
        #                   ^ Autocomplete Jinja functions and entities
```

Available completions:
- `states('entity_id')` - Get entity state
- `is_state('entity_id', 'state')` - Check state
- `state_attr('entity_id', 'attr')` - Get attribute
- `now()`, `today_at()`, `as_timestamp()` - Time functions
- `area_entities('area')`, `device_entities('device')` - Relationship functions

#### Hover Information

Hover over entity IDs to see detailed information:

```yaml
entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
#          ^ Hover here to see:
#            - Friendly name: "Living Room Temperature"
#            - State: "21.5"
#            - Unit: "°C"
#            - All attributes
```

Hover over Jinja2 templates to see the **live rendered result**:

```yaml
value_template: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') | float }}"
#               ^ Hover to see: "21.5"
```

#### Diagnostics (Warnings & Errors)

The LSP shows warnings for potential issues:

**Unknown Entity Warning:**
```yaml
entity_id: sensor.does_not_exist
#          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#          ⚠ Unknown entity: sensor.does_not_exist
```

**Unknown Service Warning:**
```yaml
service: light.invalid_service
#        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#        ⚠ Unknown service: light.invalid_service
```

**Missing Include Error:**
```yaml
automation: !include missing_file.yaml
#                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#                    ❌ Include file not found: missing_file.yaml
```

#### Go-to-Definition

Click on `!include` references to jump to the included file:

```yaml
automation: !include automations.yaml
#                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#                    Ctrl+Click to open automations.yaml
```

Also works with `!secret`:
```yaml
api_key: !secret api_key
#               ~~~~~~~~
#               Ctrl+Click to open secrets.yaml
```

### Trigger & Condition Completion

When editing automations, get completions for:

**Trigger Platforms:**
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: # state, numeric_state, time, sun, zone, mqtt, webhook...
```

**Condition Types:**
```yaml
condition:
  - condition: # state, numeric_state, time, sun, zone, template, and, or, not...
```

**Action Keys:**
```yaml
action:
  - service:     # Service to call
    target:      # Target entities/areas/devices
    data:        # Service parameters
  - delay:       # Delay before next action
  - wait_template: # Wait for condition
  - choose:      # Conditional branching
  - repeat:      # Repeat actions
```

### Configuration

LSP is enabled by default. To disable it:

1. Go to the app **Configuration** tab
2. Set **"Enable LSP Home Assistant Integration"** to `false`
3. Restart the app

### Technical Notes

- The LSP server caches entity/service data for 60 seconds for performance
- Cache is automatically refreshed when stale
- Works even without Home Assistant connection (limited features)
- YAML syntax validation is always available

---

## Working Directory

OpenCode starts in the `/homeassistant` directory, which is your Home Assistant configuration folder. This includes:

- `configuration.yaml`
- `automations.yaml`
- `scripts.yaml`
- `scenes.yaml`
- Custom components in `custom_components/`
- And all other configuration files

## Customizing AI Instructions (AGENTS.md)

The app creates an `AGENTS.md` file in your Home Assistant config directory (`/homeassistant/AGENTS.md`) on first install. This file contains instructions that guide how OpenCode behaves when working with your Home Assistant setup.

### Default Instructions Include:

- **User consent rules** - The AI won't make changes without your explicit approval
- **Home Assistant knowledge** - File structure, YAML syntax, automation patterns
- **Safety guidelines** - Protection for secrets, backup reminders, validation checks
- **MCP awareness** - How to use MCP tools when available

### Customizing the Instructions

You can edit `AGENTS.md` to add your own rules or context:

1. Open **File Editor** (or VS Code Server app)
2. Navigate to `/config/AGENTS.md`
3. Add your customizations

**Example additions:**

```markdown
## My Home Setup

- I use Zigbee2MQTT for all Zigbee devices
- My house has 3 floors: basement, main, upstairs
- Prefer MQTT automations over native HA automations
- Always use packages for new configuration

## Coding Preferences

- Use descriptive entity_id names with room prefix
- Add comments explaining automation logic
- Prefer template sensors over Node-RED
```

### Resetting to Default

If you want to restore the default `AGENTS.md`:

1. Delete or rename the existing file
2. Restart the app
3. A fresh default will be created

## Tips

### Validating Configuration

After making changes, you can ask OpenCode to validate your configuration:

```
Check if my configuration is valid
```

With MCP enabled, OpenCode calls the validation API directly and reports any errors.

### Viewing Logs

If something isn't working, check the logs:

```
Show me the recent error logs
```

Or use the helper command:

```bash
ha-logs error
```

### Git Integration

OpenCode works well with git. If you version control your configuration:

```
Show me what files have changed
```

```
Commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

### Using Semantic Summaries

Instead of raw JSON data, ask for summaries:

```
Give me a summary of all entity states
```

This returns a human-readable overview organized by domain, including any detected anomalies.

## Data Storage

Your OpenCode sessions and API credentials are stored in `/data/` within the app. This data:

- **Is backed up** when you create a Home Assistant backup
- **Persists** across app restarts and updates
- **Is private** to your Home Assistant instance

## Security Notes

- This app has access to your Home Assistant configuration files (read/write)
- This app can view system logs (Core, Supervisor, Host)
- When MCP is enabled, OpenCode can query entities and call services
- Access is protected by Home Assistant authentication via ingress
- Only users with access to the HA OpenCode panel can use this app

## Troubleshooting

### OpenCode won't start

Check if you have enough memory. OpenCode requires at least 256MB of RAM, 512MB recommended.

### Can't connect to AI provider

1. Make sure you have internet access
2. Run `/connect` again to re-authenticate
3. Check that your API key or subscription is valid

### Terminal not loading

1. Try refreshing the page
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Check the app logs in the Home Assistant Supervisor

### MCP not working

1. Make sure MCP is enabled: `ha-mcp status`
2. Restart OpenCode after enabling MCP
3. Test the connection: `ha-mcp test`
4. Check that the app has API access (it should by default)

### Entity not found in MCP queries

1. Verify the entity exists in Home Assistant
2. Check the exact entity_id spelling
3. Use `search_entities` to find entities by name

### Changes not taking effect

After modifying configuration files, you may need to:

1. Validate: **Developer Tools** > **YAML** > **Check Configuration**
2. Reload: **Developer Tools** > **YAML** > **Reload** the relevant domain
3. Or restart Home Assistant for major changes
